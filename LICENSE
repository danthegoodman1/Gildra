To keep the License simple:

Section 1: You may (not intended to be comprehensive):
a. Use this for personal projects
b. Use this within your company to power other products (e.g. a web hosting provider)
c. Use this in commercial and non commercial settings
d. Fork, clone, modify, and contribute!

Section 2: You may NOT (not comprehensive):
a. Sell hosted Gildra nodes
b. Sell a hosted Gildra control plane
c. Clone Gildra without keeping open source and openly referencing Gildra as the parent

Omission from section 2 is not express or implicit permission. Use common sense. If you are unsure, please reach out! Section 1 is also not comprehensive, there are likely more instances where Gildra would be well used.

Use common sense to determine if your use case is considered permitted and/or ethical!

The maintainers of Gildra reserve all rights to modify the License.

Any jurisdiction, action, or proceedings arising under this license or Gildra will be settled exclusively in the courts of Delaware, USA.

By using Gildra, you agree to this license.
